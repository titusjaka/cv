    - role: Principal Software Engineer (Golang)
      time: Aug 2022 – Mar 2024
      company: Headframe, Abu Dhabi (remotely)
      website: https://headframe.io/en/
      details: |
        _Headframe is a startup that develops software for Bitcoin mining and hashrate management._

        I joined the project as the first developer and worked through the entire lifecycle of the company. 
        Our team consisted of two backend developers, one frontend developer, one DevOps, and the CTO.

        Despite the fact that we were a small startup, we followed best practices.
          - All essential decisions were captured in Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).
          - Code was covered with unit and functional testing. Coverage was around 90%.
          - We had solid CI/CD processes, including automated testing, linters, and deployment to a K8s cluster.

        These concepts helped us maintain a rapid development pace throughout the company's lifecycle. I was more 
        than just a consumer of these ideals; I helped create them.

        My main achievements:
          - I developed the Stratum Relay. It's a TCP server that connects ASICs (mining devices) to a parent mining pool. 
            It was capable of serving 20,000 concurrent TCP connections with a latency as low as 20 ms.
          - I developed a virtual mining feature. Virtual mining allows users to rent ASICs with a few clicks and start 
            mining within minutes.
          - I developed an API service with over 200 endpoints. All endpoints were protected by a proper permission model.

        **Technologies**:
          - Golang, Clickhouse, PostgreSQL, Redis, Ory, SpiceDB, Docker, Kubernetes, Github, Argo CD.

        **Approaches**:
          - Kanban, code reviews, clean code architecture, [ADRs](https://adr.github.io/).

    - role: Principal Software Engineer (Golang)
      time: Nov 2021 – Jul 2022
      company: Youla (Project of VK), Moscow
      website: https://vk.company/en
      details: |
        _Youla is a geolocation-based classified ad service. The service helps users sell and buy used items._

        I worked for the infrastructure team dedicated to building the platform for the other developers. 
        My team's goal was to make launching Golang microservices smooth and fast.

        What I accomplished in this position:
          - I wrote comprehensive documentation about best practices, CI/CD, architecture, and other vital topics.
          - I created the `launchpad`, a small CLI tool that generated a new service within one command. 
            The resulting service had telemetry, CI/CD, and deployment configuration for the Kubernetes cluster.
          - I created an infrastructure framework for reusable instruments such as logging, metrics, tracing, and profiling.

        **Technologies**: 
          - Golang, Docker, Kubernetes, Gitlab.
        
        **Approaches**: 
          - Agile, code reviews, clean code architecture.

    - role: Principal Software Engineer (Golang)
      time: Feb 2021 – Jul 2021
      company: Golane, Munich (remotely)
      website: https://www.linkedin.com/company/golane
      details: |
        _Golane is a startup building a simple ticketing system for public transport._
        
        At this position, I was developing payment services.
        
          - I implemented an integration with the German payment provider LogPay.
          - I developed a calculator for the best price. This service calculates the best possible 
            combination of tickets (daily, weekly, etc.) for a user. It was an exciting and challenging 
            task since it was an NP-complex problem.
        
        **Technologies**: 
          - Golang, PostgreSQL, Docker, Kafka, GraphQL, gRPC.
        
        **Approaches**: 
          - Agile, code reviews, clean code architecture.

    - role: Senior Software Engineer (Golang)
      time: Mar 2020 – Dec 2020
      company: xpate, Riga (remotely)
      website: https://xpate.com/
      details: |
        _xpate is a fintech startup building drag&drop-centric payment system._

        I was developing the key projects of the company: the core-banking and the payment gateway.

        My main achievements:
          - I designed and developed a tariff system for the core-banking and the payment gateway.
          - I designed and developed a payment routing module and a status model for the payment gateway.

        _Unfortunately, one day the company decided to close the development department completely and use
        white-label software instead._

        **Technologies**: 
          - Golang, PostgreSQL, Docker, Gitlab, Clickhouse, Grafana.

        **Approaches**: 
          - Agile, blameless-postmortems, code reviews.

      time: Sep 2019 – Feb 2020
      company: Enjoy.ai, Minsk

      details: |
        _Enjoy.ai was a sexual wellness startup. Its goal was to help people diversify their intimate lives._
        
        I was the only developer at a small startup. I was responsible for all technical solutions and their implementation. 
        The startup operated for six months until its investment ran out. During this time, we were able to build three full 
        MVPs to test hypotheses.

        My main achievements:
        
          - I was actively involved in thinking through the company's business strategy, not just in code development.
          - I was able to implement business ideas quickly. It was important not to waste time on long development, but 
            to release the product and test the hypothesis as soon as possible.
        
        **Technologies**: 
          - Golang, NLP, JavaScript, Docker, Gitlab.

    - role: Senior Software Engineer (Golang)

      website: https://affise.com
      details: |
        _Affise is a SaaS platform for performance marketing._
        
        I was involved in the development of the core Affise platform.
        
        My main achievements:
          - I optimized two Golang services to handle 100,000 clicks per second per instance with 20 milliseconds of latency.
          - I designed an on-call duty process and instilled a culture of blameless postmortems.
        
        **Technologies**: 
          - Golang, ElasticSearch, Clickhouse, gRPC, Docker, Drone.io, Github, Ansible.
        
        **Approaches**: 
          - Agile, blameless-postmortems, code reviews, on-call duties.

      details: |
        _[Moira](https://github.com/moira-alert) is an open-source real-time alerting system designed for a massive 
        number of metrics. It processes more than 200,000 metrics per second._

        I was part of a team of two developers that developed Moira Alert. I was responsible for the entire lifecycle
        of the service. This included design, development, support, and on-call duties.

        The most significant task that I implemented was a full-text search for triggers stored in Moira. It used an
        embedded search engine and was capable of serving over 10,000 searches per second per instance.

        **Technologies**: 
          - Golang, TeamCity, GitHub, GitLab, Ansible, Docker, Travis, Redis, [bleve search](http://blevesearch.com/).

        D12 helped me learn new skills in marketing, administration, and audience engagement. 
        Unfortunately, it was not commercially viable, so I decided to close the café.
