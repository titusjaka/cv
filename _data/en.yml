  title: Career Profile
  summary: |
    I'm a software engineer with a focus on Golang. Since 2018, Go has been my primary language 
    and the core of most production systems I've worked on. I started my career in DevOps and grew 
    through early backend roles in startups and larger teams — this experience shaped my focus on 
    long-term engineering practices and system design.

    I’m a pragmatic engineer who takes initiative and solves problems with business outcomes in mind. 
    I care about impact, not just execution — and I look for ways to improve both developer experience 
    and user-facing systems.

    I’m passionate about building sustainable, fault-tolerant, and scalable software. I value maintainability,
    clean code architecture, test coverage, and clear documentation as core enablers of velocity and quality.

    **My key values:**

    - teamwork;
    - healthy communication;
    - honesty and transparency;
    - reliability.

    - role: R&D Backend Engineer
      time: Sep 2024 – Mar 2025
      company: Hellotickets, Madrid (remotely)
      website: https://www.hellotickets.com/
      details: |
        _Hellotickets is a platform for booking tickets to live events._

        I joined the R&D team to improve engineering practices, strengthen service architecture, and support product teams across the organization.  
        Over time, the company’s priorities shifted toward short-term delivery, with less emphasis on technical foundations.  
        I focused on areas where I could still bring value — but ultimately realized that I’m most effective in environments that invest in long-term architecture.

        **Key contributions:**
          - Simplified Elastic APM integration for Go services, improving observability and diagnostics.
          - Contributed to monolith refactoring by extracting a high-load event search service (e.g., concerts, matches), enhancing performance and scalability.

    - role: Founding Backend Engineer
      time: Aug 2022 – Apr 2025
      time_note: "Full-time: Aug 2022 – Mar 2024 · Advisory: Apr 2024 – Apr 2025"
      company: Headframe, Abu Dhabi (remotely)
      website: https://headframe.io/en/
      details: |
        _Headframe is a startup developing software for managing ASIC devices and renting out Bitcoin hashrate._

        I joined as the first backend engineer and helped grow the product from an early prototype to a scalable production system.

        **Key contributions (Aug 2022 – Mar 2024):**
          - Established long-term engineering foundations, including ADR-driven architecture, high test coverage (~90%), and documentation as a first-class development tool.
          - Built the **Stratum Relay**, a high-performance TCP server handling 20,000+ concurrent ASIC connections with ~20ms latency.
          - Designed the **virtual mining system**, enabling on-demand hashrate rental and reducing onboarding time from days to minutes.
          - Delivered a production-grade API with 200+ endpoints, secured with fine-grained access control via Ory and SpiceDB.

        _Since April 2024, I’ve continued supporting the company in a consulting role — advising on architecture and helping the team evolve the system._

    - role: Principal Software Engineer
      time: Nov 2021 – Jul 2022
      company: Youla (Project of VK), Moscow
      website: https://vk.company/en
      details: |
        _Youla is a location-based classifieds platform and part of the VK ecosystem._

        I was part of the infrastructure team focused on improving developer experience and streamlining Go service delivery.

        **Key contributions:**
          - Built `launchpad`, a CLI utility for scaffolding production-ready Go services — including telemetry, CI/CD, and Kubernetes deployment — with a single command.
          - Designed a modular infrastructure framework for logging, metrics, tracing, and profiling.
          - Wrote internal documentation covering service architecture, deployment pipelines, and engineering best practices.

    - role: Principal Backend Engineer
      time: Feb 2021 – Jul 2021
      company: golane, Munich (remotely)
      website: https://www.linkedin.com/company/golane
      details: |
        _Golane is a German startup building a ticketing system for public transportation._

        **Key contributions:**
          - Developed a payment service integrated with LogPay, a major local provider — enabling seamless end-to-end transit payments.
          - Built a fare optimization engine that computed the most cost-effective combination of daily and weekly tickets — 
            solving a domain-specific NP-complete problem.

    - role: Senior Backend Engineer
      time: Mar 2020 – Feb 2021
      company: xpate, Riga (remotely)
      website: https://xpate.com/
      details: |
        _Xpate is a fintech startup developing a drag-and-drop-centric payment platform._

        I worked on the company’s core banking system and payment gateway — two of its most critical services.

        **Key contributions:**
          - Designed and implemented a configurable tariff engine used across both systems.
          - Built a dynamic payment routing module and transaction status model to improve flexibility and operational transparency.

        My involvement ended when the company transitioned from internal development to a white-label solution.
