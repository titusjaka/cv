  title: Career Profile
  summary: |
    I'm an engineer who puts business value first. For me, it’s essential that a product solves real problems, 
    delivers value to users and the business, and that the team can work fast and reliably.

    My main technical stack is Go. Since 2018, it has been the backbone of every production system I’ve worked 
    on. 

    I started my career as a DevOps engineer and grew into backend roles. 
    I’ve worked in both startups and larger teams — this experience shaped my approach. 
    I value system design and long-term engineering practices.

    I pay close attention to architecture, high-load development, maintainability, and internal processes 
    — everything that keeps systems stable and scalable.

    **What I value most in work:**

    - teamwork;
    - open and respectful communication;
    - honesty and transparency;
    - reliability in people and systems.

    - role: R&D Backend Engineer
      time: Sep 2024 – Mar 2025
      company: Hellotickets, Madrid (remotely)
      website: https://www.hellotickets.com/
      details: |
        _Hellotickets is a platform for buying tickets for events worldwide._
        
        I joined the R&D team to develop engineering practices, improve service architecture, and support product teams.

        Over time, the company’s focus shifted toward frequent releases, and systemic improvements took a back seat.  
        I focused on tasks where I could still bring value but eventually realized that I work most effectively where there’s 
        a clear demand for sustainable architecture and engineering culture growth.
        
        **Key contributions:**
          - Set up and simplified Elastic APM integration for Go services — this improved observability and accelerated diagnostics.
          - Took part in monolith refactoring: extracted a high-load event search service (concerts, matches), which improved performance and made scaling easier.

    - role: Founding Backend Engineer
      time: Aug 2022 – Apr 2025
      time_note: "Full-time: Aug 2022 – Mar 2024 <br> Consultant: Apr 2024 – Apr 2025"
      company: Headframe, Abu Dhabi (remotely)
      website: https://headframe.io/en/
      details: |
        _Headframe is a startup building a system for managing ASIC devices and renting out Bitcoin hashrate._

        I was the first backend engineer in the company. During this time, the team took the product from prototype to a scalable production system.

        **Key achievements:**
          - Introduced engineering practices: ADR-based architecture, ~90% test coverage, and documentation-driven development.
          - Built the Stratum Relay — a high-load TCP server handling 20,000+ ASIC connections with ~20ms latency.
          - Designed the virtual mining system, which reduced user onboarding time from days to minutes.
          - Developed an API with 200+ endpoints and a flexible authorization model using Ory and SpiceDB.

        _From April 2024 to April 2025, I consulted for the company on architecture and system development._

    - role: Principal Backend Engineer
      time: Nov 2021 – Jul 2022
      company: Youla, Moscow
      website: https://vk.company/en
      details: |
        _Youla is a user-to-user classifieds platform, part of the VK ecosystem._

        In the infrastructure team, I was responsible for simplifying the launch of Go services and improving the overall developer experience.

        **Key achievements:**
          - Created `launchpad` — a CLI tool that generated a production-ready service with telemetry, CI/CD, and Kubernetes configuration in a single run. This cut the time to launch new services from hours to minutes.
          - Built a modular infrastructure library for logging, metrics, tracing, and profiling.
          - Wrote clear internal documentation covering service architecture, pipelines, and engineering practices.

    - role: Principal Backend Engineer
      time: Feb 2021 – Jul 2021
      company: golane, Munich (remotely)
      website: https://www.linkedin.com/company/golane
      details: |
        _Golane is a German startup developing a system for public transport payments._

        **Key achievements:**
          - Developed a payment service and integrated it with LogPay — one of the largest local providers. 
            This allowed passengers to pay for trips directly in the app.
          - Built a fare calculation module that determined the most cost-effective combination of tickets (daily, weekly, etc.). 
            The algorithm solved a complex optimization problem, similar to an NP-complete task, taking all fare rules into account.

    - role: Senior Backend Engineer
      time: Mar 2020 – Feb 2021
      company: xpate, Riga (remotely)
      website: https://xpate.com/
      details: |
        _Xpate is a fintech startup developing a payment platform with a drag-and-drop interface._

        I was in charge of the core banking system and the payment gateway — the company’s two key services.

        **Key achievements:**
          - Developed a tariff system for both the core banking platform and the gateway. 
            This helped the company adjust pricing models for different customer groups.
          - Built a payment routing module that helped reduce provider fees by selecting more cost-effective payment routes.

        Later the company discontinued in-house development and switched to an external white-label solution.
